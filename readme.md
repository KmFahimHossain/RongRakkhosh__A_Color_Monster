# RongRakkhosh - A color monster
This game was made for my L-1 T-1 CSE102 Strcutured Programming Language Sessional course's project at BUET. 
A OpenGL Library IGraphics is used.
At the time of creating this game ( February , 2024  )  , I knew very little about the core concepts of C. 
Most of the codes written also may seem funny. 
Designs and background musics are mainly taken from Canva.
